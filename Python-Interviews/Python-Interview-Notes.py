# CHAPTER-1: PYTHON INTRODUCTION
# What is python ?
"""Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language known for its simple syntax 
and readability.
=> Developed by Guide van russam in 1991.
"""

# What are the features of Python?
"""
Simple syntax and Easy to learn

Interpreted language

Object-oriented Programming language

Dynamically typed language

Platform independent

Large standard library

"""
# Is Python compiled or interpreted?
"""Python is an interpreted language (internally compiled to bytecode).
Code executes line by line. """

# What is PEP 8?
"""PEP 8 is Python’s official coding style guide."""

# What is comments in python ?
"""
In python, comments are used to add notes OR explainations to the code.

Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are only visible in the code.
"""

# Types of comments - 2
"""
1. Single line comments.
2. Multi-line comments.
"""

# Single-Line comments.
"""Single-Line comments start with the # symbol and continue until the end of the line """

# Multi-Line Comments
"""Multi-line comments are enclosed in the triple quotes (""" """  OR  ''' ''')"""


#Why use comments
"""
1. Code readability :- Comments help others understand our code.

2. Debugging :- Comments can help us to identify issues or bugs in our code.

3. Documentation :- Comments can save as documentation for our code.
"""

# What is indentation in Python?
"""Indentation defines code blocks. Python uses indentation instead of braces {}"""

# What is type casting?
"""Type casting is converting one data type into another data type."""
# OR
"""Type casting is the manual conversion of one data type into another data type
 using Python’s built-in functions."""

n1 = int(input("Enter first number : "))   # converting string into integer# 
n2 = int(input("Enter second number : "))  # converting string into integer# 

# Note:-  User input values always return in string.

# What is None in Python?
"""None represents the absence of a value."""

# What is a keyword in Python? 
"""Keywords are the reserved words in python."""
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHAPTER-2 : VARIABLES IN PYTHON

# What is variable in python ?
"""Variable is a container used to stored  different types of values"""
# OR
"""Variable is the the name of memory location where we stored differnt types values"""

# Example 
name = "Eshwar"
print(name)
print(type(name))

# What is global and local variable?
"""
1. Global variable is accessible everywhere
2. local variable is accessible only inside a function or block.
"""
# Example:- GLOBAL VARIABLE..............................
x = 10   # global variable

def show():
    print(x)

show()
print(x)

# Exmaple:- LOCAL VARIABLE...................................
def display():
    y = 20   # local variable
    print(y)

display()
# print(y)  ❌ Error


# What is type() function ?
"""The type() function is used to find the data type of a variable or value."""

# Example 
name = "Eshwar"
print(name)
print(type(name))

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHAPTER-3 : DATA TYPES IN PYTHON

# What is data type in python ?
"""Data type represents the different kinds of values that we stored on the variable"""

# Why called python is a dynamically typed  language ?
"""No need to specify the data type explicitly, 
based on the values type python allocated automatically at the run time"""

x = 10      # int
z = 7.5     # float
y = "Hi"    # str

# Dtatypes 
"""
1. Int  
2. Float
3. Complex
4. String
5. Boolean
6. None    ====>>> None represents the absence of a value.
7. List
8. Tuple
9. Set
10. Dictionary (dict)
"""
# What are the built-in data types in Python?
"""
Python has the following built-in data types:

Numeric → int, float, complex

Sequence → list, tuple, range

Text → str

Set → set, frozenset

Mapping → dict

Boolean → bool

# CHAPTER-4 :  INPUT() FUNCTION IN PYTHON

# What is the input() function in Python?
"""Input() function is used to take input from the user during program execution."""

"""The input() function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number."""

"""An operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands."""

# Types of Operators
"""
1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, **, //)
2. Relational / Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

# Key Interview Points to Remember
"""
1. Strings are immutable

2. They are indexed

3. Stored as Unicode

4. Written using ' ', " ", or """ """
"""

# Are strings mutable or immutable in Python?
"""Strings are immutable, because their values cannot be changed after creation."""
# Example
s = "hello"

# How do you access characters in a string?
"""Using indexing."""

# Example
s = "Python"
print(s[0]) # P

# What is string slicing?
"""Slicing is used to extract a part of a string."""

# Syntax
""" string[start:end:step] """
# Example
s = "Python"
print(s[1:4])

# What is the difference between == and is for strings?
"""
1. == compares values

2. is compares memory locations
"""
# Example
a = "hi"
b = "hi"
print(a == b) # True

# How do you find the length of a string?
"""Using len() function."""

# Example
s = "Python"

# What is string concatenation?
"""Joining two or more strings using +."""

# Example
a = "Hello"

# How do you repeat a string?
"""Using * operator."""

# Example
s = "Hi"

# What are common string methods in Python?
"""
     Method	        Description
    lower() 	    Converts to lowercase
    upper()	        Converts to uppercase
    strip()	        Removes spaces
    replace()	    Replaces substring
    split()	        Splits string
    find()	        Finds substring
"""

# Difference between find() and index()?
"""
1. find() → returns -1 if not found

2. index() → raises error if not found
"""
# Example
s = "python"

# print(s.index('z')) ❌ Error

# What is split() method?
"""Splits a string into a list."""

# Example
s = "Python is easy"

# What is join() method?
"""Joins elements of a list into a string."""

# Example
words = ['Python', 'is', 'easy']

# What is string formatting?
"""Used to insert values into strings."""

# Example
# a) f-string (Recommended)
name = "Eshwar"

# How do you reverse a string?
s = "Python"
print(s[::-1])

# How do you check if a string is palindrome?
s = "madam"

# How do you count occurrences of a character?
s = "banana"

# What is strip(), lstrip(), rstrip()?
"""Removes spaces from string."""
s = " hello "

# How to check string type (numeric, alpha)?

# What are escape characters?
"""Special characters starting with \.
Examples:

\n → New line

\t → Tab
"""

# Is empty string allowed in Python?
"""Yes"""

# Example
